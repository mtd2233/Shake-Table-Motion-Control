//Transforming the motor's rotary motion into linear motion by using a threaded rod:
//Threaded rod's pitch = 2 mm. This means that one revolution will move the nut 2 mm.
//Default stepping = 400 step/revolution.
// 400 step = 1 revolution = 8 mm linear motion. (4 start 2 mm pitch screw)
// 1 cm = 10 mm =>> 10/8 * 400 = 4000/8 = 500 steps are needed to move the nut by 1 cm.
// After E is ran and a new cmd is run as shakeUpdate needs to reset motion params 
 
//character for commands
/*
     'C' : Prints all the commands and their functions.
     'P' : Rotates the motor in positive (CW) direction, relative.
     'N' : Rotates the motor in negative (CCW) direction, relative.
     'R' : Rotates the motor to an absolute positive position (+).
